Class: IWorker
    Description:
        IWorker is an abstract class that defines the necessary methods for
        a worker that can be used by the ServerDaemon class in feanta_server.
        The get_command_list and execute functions should be implemented in
        each concrete implementation of IWorker. When an IWorker is linked
        to a ServerDaemon, its internal logger function is replaced, but by
        default, the logging function is simply a print to standard out.

    Method: set_logger
        Description:
            This method allows the ServerDaemon to set the logging method
            of each of its workers as necessary.
        Arguments:
            logging_method: a pointer a method that accepts one argument,
                a string to be logged.

    Method: get_command_list
        Description:
            Method used to return a list of commands that this instance of
            IWorker is responsible for. When the ACC issues commands from this
            list, then, the ServerDaemon will be able to determine that
            this is the worker to be used.
        Returns:
            This method should return a simple list of commands.
            i.e. ['BRICKCAL', 'BRICKMOVE']

            The implementation of this method should be able to handle every
            command from get_command_list.

        Description:
            This method is called on by the server to poll data from each
            of the workers. Depending on the worker, the return format
            may be different.
        Returns:
            Generally should return a dictionary with the polled data.
